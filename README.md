GitHub How to Add File to Repository  (2018/10/04)

I can't find the Upload button...

It looks like you created a new repository without a README or other document. This would explain why you're not seeing
the "Upload File" button.

Since you already created your repository without a README, you can add one by clicking on the "README" link (this is
shown in your screenshot under the HTTPS URL). That will start a new README file for you. In the form you're taken to,
you can write a brief description of what your repository is about/for. Once you've added that content to your README
file, you'll need to write a commit message in the "Commit changes" box below the file editor. Writing good commit
messages is a subject worthy of it's own guide, but an example of a good message you could use for this commit would
be: "Create README.md". Then click "Commit changes” button near the bottom of the page.

Once you've done that, you'll be taken back to your Code tab and you'll now see the "Upload Files" option in the upper
right (between "Create new file" and "Find file"). That's where you can upload an already-existing file to your repository.
Then click "Commit changes” button near the bottom of the page.
